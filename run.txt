# SaaS API Run Instructions

## 1. Environment Setup
Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with correct database credentials.
Copy `.env.example` if available.

## 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
go mod tidy
```

## 3. Database Seeding
Initialize the database with default roles, an admin user, and organizational data.
```bash
go run cmd/seed/main.go

**You do NOT need to run swag init anymore.**
The API documentation is generated dynamically at runtime.
